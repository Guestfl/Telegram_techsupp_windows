# Support_telegram_bot

 !!! > In Form1.cs you should add bot's Telegram API. Then make folder with Json files and add this path in dir!

This code can be optimized, but it has all opportunities with the exception of work dividing the message on the screen.
Almost all other options are made at the design stage.

I used Telegram.bot 16.0.2, and there are most of classes - Obsolete. After a full update this code must be slightly adapted.
